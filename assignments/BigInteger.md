# Assignment 2
## Problem Statement

Suppose python integer data types can't hold values greater than 10^18, now you have to design a class named BigInteger that supports the following:
* Basic arithmetic operations, addition, multiplication, division, subtraction, modulo and gcd
* Basic comparison operations, < <= > >= == != 

These are basic functionalities, but you're not restricted to these only.
